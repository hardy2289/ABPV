As part of my Project Dissertation in MsC Software Engineering, I have created Android Application for Patients where they can book the Appointment using the application based on available slots and doctor can approve or decline the Appointments based on the priority, also Doctors can provide the Prescription and Patients can view their Prescription using application. This application was made using Android Studio (Java & JavaScript Language).
